# HockeyDataScrapper
This is a web scrapper that scrapes the data from the website [Hockey Reference](https://www.hockey-reference.com/) and stores the data in a csv file. The user inputs which statistic they want for the X and Y axis and a scatter plot will be created plotting the name and stats of players.
